# Marketing Channel Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of marketing performance across three major channels: **Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and Web (Organic/Non-Paid)**. The goal is to evaluate how ad spend correlates with revenue, user sessions, and total orders, helping stakeholders make informed decisions on marketing investments.

## Objective

- Assess the efficiency of paid marketing channels (Google Ads and Facebook Ads).
- Compare performance between paid and organic (non-paid) channels.
- Analyze trends in revenue, sessions, and orders from 2016 to 2021.
- Provide actionable recommendations for improving marketing strategies.

## Data Sources

- **Google Ads** — Daily ad spend data.
- **Facebook Ads** — Daily campaign cost data.
- **Google Analytics Paid** — Sessions and transactions from paid campaigns.
- **Google Analytics Non-Paid** — Sessions and transactions from organic traffic.

## Key Metrics

| Metric            | Value     |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Total Revenue     | 5.74M     |
| Total Ad Spend    | 438.08K   |
| Google Ads Spend  | 237.76K   |
| Facebook Spend    | 200.32K   |
| Total Orders      | 30K       |

## Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI** for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **SQL** for querying and extracting structured data.
- **Python (Pandas)** for data cleaning, merging, and preprocessing.

## Dashboard Features

- **Ad Spend vs Revenue by Channel**  
  Compares how each channel performs relative to the amount spent.

- **Revenue and Session Trends (2016–2021)**  
  Tracks changes over time to identify growth periods and declines.

- **Paid vs Non-Paid Sessions**  
  Shows reliance on organic traffic compared to paid campaigns.

- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**  
  Measures how effectively each ad platform converts spend into revenue.

- **Cost Per Order Analysis**  
  Determines the efficiency of customer acquisition across channels.

- **Interactive Filters**  
  Filter by channel and date range for detailed exploration.

## Key Insights

- **Google Ads outperformed Facebook Ads** in terms of revenue generation and order conversion.
- **Organic (Non-Paid) traffic was a major contributor**, consistently higher than paid traffic.
- A **noticeable revenue decline occurred after 2019**, suggesting a need to revisit campaign strategies.
- Facebook Ads showed lower efficiency, signaling room for improvement in audience targeting and content.

## Recommendations

1. Increase investment in **Google Ads**, which demonstrated higher ROAS.
2. Optimize **Facebook Ads** by refining audience segmentation and creative strategies.
3. Continue strengthening **organic channels** through SEO, content marketing, and brand-building.
4. Diversify into additional marketing platforms such as **Instagram, YouTube, and Display Ads**.
5. Investigate the revenue drop post-2019 to determine if it was caused by external factors or internal inefficiencies.
